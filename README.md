Work on Chess

Author: Siddharth Dave

Project: Ryerson University Project

Objective: Designing a two player Chess game with a JFrame based GUI on Netbeans 7.2 IDE.

File information:
Board -> Represents the actual board diagram with 8x8 Chess board drawn on the GUI using simple Boxes.
Manager -> The brains of the game. Listens to the button clicks and determines what is pressed and takes the necessary actions.
Pieces -> Parent to all the actual pieces of the game.

Each piece has it's own 'special moves' and takes input the position of the game and gives a green light as to where it can move based on its moving algorithm.
The decision is made by manager and the move is made based on clicks.
